# pi-lens

pi-lens focuses on real-time inline code feedback for AI agents.

## What It Does

### On Write/Edit

On every `write` and `edit`, pi-lens runs a fast, language-aware pipeline (checks depend on file language, project config, and installed tools):

1. **Secrets scan** — blocking; aborts the write if credentials are detected
2. **Auto-format** — deferred to `agent_end` by default; queued files are formatted once after all agent tool calls complete. Use `--immediate-format` or global config `format.mode: "immediate"` for per-edit formatting
3. **Auto-fix** — safe autofixes from 6 tools (Biome `check --write`, Ruff `check --fix`, ESLint `--fix`, stylelint `--fix`, sqlfluff `fix`, RuboCop `-a`) applied before analysis
4. **Edit autopatch** — before an `edit` tool call lands, pi-lens silently corrects two classes of `oldText` mismatch: leading tab/space indentation (when the corrected text matches exactly one location) and trailing whitespace stripped by formatters. Both corrections also retarget `newText` so the replacement matches the file's whitespace style
5. **LSP file sync** — opens/updates the file in active language servers
5. **Dispatch lint** — parallel runner groups: LSP diagnostics, tree-sitter structural rules, ast-grep security/correctness rules, fact rules, language-specific linters, experimental Semgrep security scans, similarity detection
6. **Cascade diagnostics** — review-graph impact cascade showing which other files were affected and how diagnostics propagated

Results are inline and actionable:

- **Blocking issues** — stop progress until fixed
- **Warnings** — summarized inline, detail in `/lens-booboo`
- **Health/telemetry** — available in `/lens-health`

### Agent End

At `agent_end` (once per user prompt, after all agent tool calls complete):

- **Deferred formatting** — any files queued during the turn are formatted once, synced to LSP, and tracked for read-guard coverage
- **Conservative LSP warning autofix** — when `actionableWarnings.autoFix.enabled` is set, applies up to 5 preferred LSP quickfixes for warnings flagged in the turn's actionable warnings report. Each fix is re-validated against the live LSP server at apply time, checked for ambiguity (skipped if multiple eligible actions exist), and gated by a safety check before any write occurs. Changed files are registered with the read-guard and cache manager
- **Summary notification** — concise status: how many files were formatted, which changed, and whether any formatter failed

### Session Start

At `session_start`, pi-lens:

- resets runtime state and diagnostic telemetry
- detects project root, language profile, and active tools
- applies language-aware startup defaults for tool preinstall
- warms caches and optional indexes (with overlap/session guardrails)
- emits missing-tool install hints for detected languages when relevant
- prepends session guidance before the user's prompt so provider bridges keep the real prompt active
- opens `warmFiles` (if configured in `.pi-lens/lsp.json`) to seed lazy-indexing language servers like clangd before the first symbol query

For one-shot print sessions (for example `pi --print ...`), pi-lens auto-uses a quick startup path that skips heavy bootstrap work to reduce startup latency. Override with `PI_LENS_STARTUP_MODE=full|minimal|quick`.

### Turn End

At `turn_end`, pi-lens:

- summarizes deferred findings (for example duplicates/circulars)
- persists turn findings for next context injection
- updates debt/diagnostic tracking and cleans transient state
- renders a review-graph impact cascade showing affected files and diagnostic propagation
- fires test runs for all modified files (non-blocking); failures are injected into the next turn's context when ready
- manages LSP server lifecycle with a 240s idle timeout (resets when editing resumes)
- **Actionable warnings report** — writes `.pi-lens/cache/actionable-warnings.json` with fixable warnings introduced by the current turn (delta-only by default). Merges pipeline `fixable` diagnostics with optional LSP code-action warnings. Uses stable `aw:<hash>` IDs so warnings can be tracked and suppressed across turns. When warnings are present, injects a concise advisory into the agent context instead of blocker language

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-lens
```

Or from git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/apmantza/pi-lens
```

## Features

### LSP Support

pi-lens includes **37 language server definitions**. LSP is **enabled by default** (`--lsp` or no flag). Servers are auto-discovered from PATH, project `node_modules`, and managed installs. When a server is not installed, pi-lens offers an interactive install prompt.

**LSP Idle Management:** LSP servers shut down after 240 seconds of inactivity (no files modified) to free resources. The timer resets when you resume editing, preventing cold-start penalties during active development.

**Warm files:** For language servers that index lazily (e.g. clangd), configure `warmFiles` in `.pi-lens/lsp.json` to open entry-point files at session start so the server has AST/index context before the first symbol query:

```json
{ "warmFiles": ["src/main.cpp", "src/lib.cpp"] }
```

**Agent LSP tools:** `lsp_diagnostics` can check one file, a directory, or an explicit `filePaths` batch with bounded concurrency. `lsp_navigation` provides definitions, references, hover, workspace symbols, call hierarchy, rename edits, and `findSymbol` for filtered document-symbol lookup. Rename accepts `apply: true` to write the returned workspace edits to disk immediately, with per-file LSP re-sync after application.

LSP servers for: TypeScript, Deno, Python (pyright/basedpyright + jedi), Go, Rust, Ruby (ruby-lsp + solargraph), PHP, C# (omnisharp), F#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, Lua, C/C++, Zig, Haskell, Elixir, Gleam, OCaml, Clojure, Terraform, Nix, Bash, Docker, YAML, JSON, HTML, TOML, Prisma, Vue, Svelte, ESLint, CSS.

### Formatters

pi-lens auto-detects and runs **32 formatters** based on project config:

biome, prettier, oxfmt, ruff, black, sqlfluff, gofmt, rustfmt, zig fmt, dart format, shfmt, nixfmt, mix format, ocamlformat, clang-format, ktlint, rubocop, standardrb, gleam format, terraform fmt, php-cs-fixer, csharpier, fantomas, swiftformat, stylua, ormolu, taplo, fish_indent, google-java-format, cljfmt, cmake-format, psscriptanalyzer-format

Detection rules:

- **Config-gated**: only runs when project config indicates usage (e.g. `biome.json`, `.prettierrc`, `ruff.toml`)
- **Nearest-wins**: when multiple formatter configs exist at different directory levels, the one closest to the edited file wins
- **Biome-default**: for JS/TS files without Prettier or Biome config, Biome is used as the default formatter
- **Ruff-default**: for Python files without Black config, Ruff format is used when available

### Review Graph - Cascade Diagnostics

pi-lens builds a review graph (`file → symbol → dependency`) during session and uses it at turn end to render an impact cascade: which files were affected by a change and how diagnostics propagated through the dependency graph. Nodes track kind, language, and export status; edges track contains/imports/calls/references.

### Read-Before-Edit Guard

pi-lens enforces a **read-before-edit** policy on all file writes and edits. Before allowing a `write` or `edit` tool call on an existing file, it verifies that the agent has previously read sufficient context:

- **Zero-read block** — blocks any edit to a file not read in the current session. Agent-created files are exempt: when a `write` tool creates a new file, pi-lens registers the written content as a synthetic read, so an immediate follow-up `edit` is not blocked
- **File-modified block** — blocks if the file changed on disk since the last read (auto-format, external tool, or a previous edit that was then reformatted)
- **Out-of-range block** — blocks if the edit target lines fall outside the ranges previously read, ensuring the agent cannot modify code it hasn't seen
- **Snapshot validation** — covered edit ranges are hash-checked against the lines the agent actually saw at read time; stale-range edits are rejected even when range coverage exists. Hash capture covers reads up to 3 000 lines

Coverage is tracked across multiple reads: two reads of lines 1–100 and 101–200 together satisfy a full-file write. Symbol-expanded reads (small reads silently widened to the enclosing symbol via tree-sitter) count toward coverage at the symbol level. Markdown files generate a warning instead of blocking (edits outside the section-expanded read range are warned, not silently passed). Plain-text (`.txt`) and log (`.log`) files remain fully exempt.

Override for a single edit: `/lens-allow-edit <path>`

Configure behavior with `--no-read-guard` to disable entirely, or set mode to `warn` instead of `block`.

### Actionable Warnings

At `turn_end`, pi-lens writes `.pi-lens/cache/actionable-warnings.json` summarizing fixable warnings introduced by the current turn. This powers the optional conservative autofix at `agent_end`.

**Report contents:**
- Warnings are delta-only by default: only diagnostics in lines touched during the current turn are included. Pass `--lens-actionable-warning-all` to report all warnings regardless of location
- Each warning carries a stable `aw:<hash>` ID derived from file, rule, and message, so suppression state persists across turns in `.pi-lens/cache/actionable-warning-state.json`
- Sources: pipeline `fixable` diagnostics (always included) and LSP code-action warnings when `--lens-actionable-warning-actions` is set
- When warnings are present, a concise advisory is injected into the agent context (no blocker language)

**Conservative autofix (`agent_end`):**

When `actionableWarnings.autoFix.enabled` is set in global config (or `--lens-actionable-warning-autofix`), pi-lens applies LSP quickfixes from the report at `agent_end`. Safety gates:
- Re-fetches code actions from the live LSP server at fix time (stale actions are skipped)
- Skips any warning with zero or multiple eligible actions (ambiguity is not resolved)
- Applies only `edit`-kind actions (no command-only or create/delete operations)
- Hard cap of 5 fixes per `agent_end`
- Suppressed warnings are never autofixed

**Flags:**
- `--lens-actionable-warnings` — enable the turn_end report
- `--lens-actionable-warning-actions` — include LSP code-action warnings in the report
- `--lens-actionable-warning-autofix` — apply conservative fixes at agent_end
- `--lens-actionable-warning-all` — report all warnings, not just delta

### Opportunistic Read Expansion

When the agent reads a small slice of a file (≤ 60 lines), pi-lens transparently expands the read to the full enclosing symbol (function, method, or class) using the tree-sitter AST. The agent receives the full symbol as context, and the read guard records symbol-level coverage so edits anywhere within that symbol pass without requiring the agent to have read every line individually. Expansion runs within a 200 ms budget and falls back silently on unsupported file types or parse failures.

Supported: TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, JSX, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby.

### Fact Rules Pipeline

Covers JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, Shell, and CMake. A TypeScript AST-based fact-rule engine extracts function-level metrics and evaluates quality and security rules inline. Blocking rules surface immediately at write time; advisory rules are available via `/lens-booboo`.

**Blocking (surface inline at write time):**

- **cors-wildcard** — `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` in server-side code
- **error-swallowing** — empty catch block (skips documented local fallbacks and fs-boundary catches)
- **no-commented-credentials** — password/token/secret in commented-out code
- **high-entropy-string** — string literals with suspiciously high Shannon entropy (possible hardcoded secret)

**Advisory (accessible via `/lens-booboo`):**

- **high-complexity** / **no-complex-conditionals** — cyclomatic complexity and deeply nested conditions
- **high-fan-out** — function calls too many distinct functions (coordination smell)
- **unsafe-boundary** — dangerous `any` casts at API boundaries
- **async-noise** / **async-unnecessary-wrapper** — async functions with no await; wrappers that add no value
- **pass-through-wrappers** — trivial wrapper functions
- **dynamic-regexp** — `new RegExp(variable)` (potential ReDoS; complements tree-sitter `unsafe-regex`)
- **jwt-without-verify** — `jwt.sign()` without `jwt.verify()` in the same file
- **missing-error-propagation** — catch blocks that log but don't rethrow
- **error-obscuring** — catch blocks that wrap errors in a different type
- **duplicate-string-literal** / **no-boolean-params** / **high-import-coupling** — code-quality signals

### Tree-sitter Rules

Structural rules organized by language in `rules/tree-sitter-queries/`. Rules marked **🔴** block the agent inline at write time (only for lines in the current edit); others are advisory.

**TypeScript (23 rules):**
🔴 `eval`, `sql-injection`, `ts-command-injection`, `ts-ssrf`, `ts-xss-dom-sink`, `ts-dynamic-require`, `ts-open-redirect`, `ts-nosql-injection`, `ts-weak-hash`, `ts-hallucinated-react-import`, `unsafe-regex`, `debugger`, `default-not-last`, `duplicate-function-arg`, `empty-switch-case`, `infinite-loop`, `self-assignment`, `switch-case-termination`  
⚠️ `console-statement`, `deep-promise-chain`, `mixed-async-styles`, `ts-insecure-random`, `ts-detached-async-call`, `ts-react-antipatterns`, `ts-weak-hash`, `variable-shadowing`

**Python:** 🔴 `python-command-injection`, `python-sql-injection`, `python-insecure-deserialization`, `python-weak-hash`, `python-hallucinated-import` + 20 advisory rules

**Go:** 🔴 `go-command-injection`, `go-sql-injection`, `go-shared-map-write-goroutine`, `go-weak-hash` + 13 advisory rules

**Rust:** 🔴 `rust-lock-held-across-await` + 3 advisory rules (`rust-unsafe-block`, `rust-expect`, `rust-clone-in-loop`)

**Ruby:** 🔴 `ruby-weak-hash` + 14 advisory rules

**Suppressing a finding:** add `// pi-lens-ignore: rule-id` on the flagged line or the line above (JS/TS), or `# pi-lens-ignore: rule-id` for Python/Ruby/Shell. This suppresses that specific rule at that location only.

**Project-wide disabling** is not currently supported through config — there is no `.pi-lens/disabled-rules` file. Use inline suppression for per-occurrence overrides. When editing pi-lens itself, move a rule file to the `<language>-disabled/` directory to prevent it from running.

### Ast-Grep Rules

**180+ rules** in `rules/ast-grep-rules/` across JS, TS, and Python:

- **Security** — no-eval, jwt-no-verify, no-hardcoded-secrets, no-insecure-randomness, no-inner-html, no-javascript-url, weak-rsa-key
- **Correctness** — strict-equality, no-cond-assign, no-constant-condition, no-dupe-keys, no-nan-comparison, array-callback-return, constructor-super
- **Style/smells** — nested-ternary, long-parameter-list, large-class, prefer-optional-chain, redundant-state, require-await
- **Agent stubs** — no-unimplemented-stub, no-raise-not-implemented, no-ellipsis-body

### Semgrep CLI Integration (Experimental)

pi-lens can run the locally installed `semgrep` CLI as an optional dispatch runner for security-focused findings. Semgrep diagnostics are normalized into the same pi-lens `Diagnostic` model as LSP, tree-sitter, ast-grep, and linters: high-signal security findings can become blocking, while other findings remain warnings for `/lens-booboo`/history.

Activation is intentionally gated:

- pi-lens **does not auto-install Semgrep**.
- A local `.semgrep.yml`, `.semgrep.yaml`, `semgrep.yml`, or `semgrep.yaml` enables the runner when the `semgrep` CLI is available.
- Without a local config, Semgrep stays skipped unless explicitly configured with `--lens-semgrep --lens-semgrep-config <auto|p/pack|path>` or `/lens-semgrep enable --config <auto|p/pack|path>`.
- Local `.semgrep.yml` scans do not require a Semgrep token. Semgrep AppSec/Pro/managed configurations may require `semgrep login` or `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN`.
- pi-lens passes `--metrics=off` for dispatch scans.

Commands:

- `/lens-semgrep status` — show CLI availability, discovered local config, persisted pi-lens config, and effective dispatch state
- `/lens-semgrep init` — create a starter `.semgrep.yml` with a blocking `eval(...)` rule and enable Semgrep dispatch
- `/lens-semgrep enable [--config <auto|p/pack|path>]` — persist Semgrep dispatch activation in `.pi-lens/semgrep.json`
- `/lens-semgrep disable` — persistently disable Semgrep dispatch for this project
- `/lens-semgrep clear` — remove `.pi-lens/semgrep.json` and return to local-config auto-discovery

Local rules can opt into pi-lens blocking semantics with metadata:

```yaml
metadata:
  pi-lens:
    semantic: blocking
    defect_class: injection
    confidence: high
```

## Dependencies

Auto-install behavior depends on gate type:

- **Config-gated**: installs only when project config/deps indicate usage
- **Flow/language-gated**: installs when the runtime path needs it for the current file/session flow
- **Operational prewarm**: installs during session warm scans / turn-end analysis paths
- **GitHub release**: platform-specific binary downloaded from GitHub releases to `~/.pi-lens/bin/`

```

## Global Config

pi-lens reads optional user preferences from `~/.pi-lens/config.json` (`%USERPROFILE%\\.pi-lens\\config.json` on Windows). Unknown keys are ignored, and missing or invalid config falls back to defaults.

Hide the diagnostics widget by default, run formatting immediately after write/edit tool calls instead of at `agent_end`, and enable actionable warnings with conservative autofix:

```json
{
  "widget": {
    "visible": false
  },
  "format": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": "immediate"
  },
  "actionableWarnings": {
    "enabled": true,
    "includeLspCodeActions": true,
    "deltaOnly": true,
    "autoFix": {
      "enabled": false,
      "maxFixes": 5
    }
  }
}
```

`format.mode` can be `"deferred"` (default) or `"immediate"`. Set `format.enabled` to `false` to match `--no-autoformat`. `/lens-widget-toggle` still works as a session-only override.

`actionableWarnings.enabled` gates the turn_end report. `includeLspCodeActions` fetches LSP code actions for each warning (requires an active language server). `deltaOnly` (default `true`) limits the report to lines touched in the current turn. `autoFix.enabled` applies conservative LSP quickfixes at `agent_end`; `autoFix.maxFixes` caps the number applied per turn (default `5`).

## Environment Variables

- `PILENS_DATA_DIR` — redirect per-project state (scanner caches,
  turn-state.json) out of the project directory. By default pi-lens writes
  `<cwd>/.pi-lens/`; if set, it writes to
  `<PILENS_DATA_DIR>/<sanitized-cwd-slug>/` instead. Useful for keeping repos
  clean or for mounted/ephemeral setups. Tool binaries always live in
  `~/.pi-lens/bin/` regardless.
- `PI_LENS_STARTUP_MODE` — `full` | `minimal` | `quick`. Override the
  auto-selected startup path. One-shot `pi --print` sessions auto-use `quick`
  to reduce latency.

## Key Commands

- `/lens-toggle` — toggle pi-lens on/off for the current session without restarting
- `/lens-widget-toggle` — show/hide the pi-lens diagnostics widget below the editor
- `/lens-booboo` — full quality report for current project state
- `/lens-health` — runtime health, latency, and diagnostic telemetry
- `/lens-allow-edit <path>` — override the read-before-edit guard for a single edit
- `/lens-tools` — tool installation status: globally installed, auto-installed, or npx fallback
- `/lens-tdi` — Technical Debt Index (TDI) and project health trend
- `/lens-semgrep` — manage experimental Semgrep dispatch (`status`, `init`, `enable`, `disable`, `clear`)

## Language Coverage

pi-lens supports **36+ languages** through dispatch runners and LSP integration.

Formatting uses a single selected formatter per file: explicit project config wins, otherwise pi-lens uses a smart default where supported, and config-first ecosystems do not autoformat without config.

Dispatch is diagnostics-oriented: automatic formatting and safe autofix happen in the post-write pipeline rather than through dispatch format-check runners.
